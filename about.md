Hello! I’m Stef, a 30-something German living in Berlin after having lived in London for 9 years. I have degrees in Literary Studies and Publishing, and have been working in book production since 2012.

I’m also an amateur writer/blogger/designer/illustrator currently on a mission to teach myself graphic design.

This blog is here to chronicle my design journey, everyday thoughts and lots of book talk, both about their content and their looks.
